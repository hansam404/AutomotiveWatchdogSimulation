# AutomotiveWatchdogSimulation
This repository contains a simulation of a watchdog timer, a critical component in automotive electronic control units (ECUs).  It showcases how watchdog timers prevent system failures by monitoring ECU health and triggering resets when necessary.  Ideal for learning about automotive safety and embedded systems.
